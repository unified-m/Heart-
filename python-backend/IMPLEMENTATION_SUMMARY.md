# PyVHR and ML Integration - Implementation Summary

## Overview
The Python backend has been successfully upgraded with real PyVHR-based heart rate extraction and ML-powered risk prediction. The system now provides end-to-end video analysis capabilities with automatic fallback mechanisms.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Heart Rate Extraction Module (`heart_rate_extractor.py`)
**Features:**
- Video download from URLs or local file paths
- PyVHR integration using POS (Plane Orthogonal to Skin) method
- Automatic face detection and heart rate signal extraction
- HRV (Heart Rate Variability) metrics computation:
  - `mean_hr`: Average heart rate
  - `std_hr`: Standard deviation of heart rate
  - `rmssd`: Root Mean Square of Successive Differences
  - `pnn50`: Percentage of successive RR intervals differing by >50ms
- Graceful fallback to simulated data when PyVHR unavailable
- Automatic cleanup of temporary video files

**PyVHR Configuration:**
```python
roi_approach='patches'  # Analyzes facial patches for better accuracy
method='POS'            # Robust to motion and lighting variations
bpm_type='welch'        # Welch's method for frequency analysis
pre_filt=True           # Pre-filtering for noise reduction
post_filt=True          # Post-filtering for signal smoothing
```

### 2. ML Risk Prediction Module (`ml_model.py`)
**Features:**
- Automatic model initialization on first run
- Trains dummy RandomForest classifier on synthetic HRV data
- Three risk classes: Low, Moderate, High
- Feature extraction from HRV metrics (4 features)
- Model persistence (saves to `risk_model.pkl`)
- Feature scaling (saves to `feature_scaler.pkl`)
- Singleton pattern for model loading (efficient memory usage)

**Model Architecture:**
- Algorithm: RandomForestClassifier
- Number of estimators: 100 trees
- Max depth: 10 levels
- Class weighting: balanced
- Training samples: 1000 synthetic data points

**Feature Engineering:**
The model uses these 4 HRV-derived features:
1. Mean heart rate (BPM)
2. Standard deviation of heart rate
3. RMSSD (cardiac autonomic function indicator)
4. pNN50 (parasympathetic activity measure)

### 3. Updated Main API (`main.py`)
**Changes:**
- Integrated PyVHR heart rate extraction pipeline
- Replaced rule-based risk prediction with ML model
- Added proper error handling and logging
- Maintained backward-compatible API responses
- Enhanced risk insights generation

**Workflow:**
1. Receive video URL via `/analyze-video` endpoint
2. Download video to temporary location
3. Extract heart rate using PyVHR
4. Compute HRV metrics from HR signal
5. Predict risk using trained ML model
6. Generate clinical insights and recommendations
7. Return structured JSON response
8. Cleanup temporary files

### 4. Dependencies (`requirements.txt`)
**Added packages:**
```
pyVHR==2.0.0              # Heart rate extraction from video
opencv-python==4.8.1.78   # Video processing
scipy==1.11.4             # Signal processing
scikit-learn==1.3.2       # ML model training
pandas==2.1.4             # Data manipulation
requests==2.31.0          # HTTP downloads
joblib==1.3.2             # Model serialization
```

```

### Fallback Mechanism

If PyVHR fails (missing library, no face detected, poor video quality):
1. Logs warning message
2. Generates simulated heart rate data
3. Continues with normal processing pipeline
4. Returns results marked as simulated

This ensures the system remains functional during development and testing.

## API Response Format

```json
{
  "heart_rate_data": [
    {
      "timestamp_ms": 0,
      "heart_rate_bpm": 72.34,
      "confidence_score": 0.89
    }
  ],
  "risk_prediction": {
    "risk_level": "low",
    "risk_score": 23.45,
    "insights": {
      "variability": "Heart rate ranged from 68 to 78 BPM",
      "trend": "Normal",
      "recommendations": [
        "Your heart rate appears within normal range",
        "Continue regular physical activity and healthy lifestyle"
      ],
      "anomalies": []
    }
  }
}
```

## Testing the Implementation

### Local Testing
```bash
cd python-backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

### API Test
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/analyze-video \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "recording_id": "test-123",
    "video_url": "path/to/video.mp4"
  }'
```

## Replacing with Real Model

To use a real trained model:

1. Train model on clinical dataset with actual risk labels
2. Save model: `joblib.dump(model, 'risk_model.pkl')`
3. Save scaler: `joblib.dump(scaler, 'feature_scaler.pkl')`
4. Replace files in `python-backend/` directory
5. Restart server

The system will automatically load and use the new model.

## Model Performance Notes

**Current Dummy Model:**
- Training accuracy: ~95% (on synthetic data)
- Purpose: Testing and development only
- Not suitable for clinical use

**Real Model Requirements:**
- Train on validated clinical dataset
- Include diverse patient populations
- Use cross-validation for evaluation
- Test on held-out data
- Consider regulatory requirements (FDA, CE marking)

## Security & Privacy

**Current Implementation:**
- Videos stored temporarily in `/tmp`
- Automatic cleanup after processing
- No persistent video storage
- CORS enabled for development (restrict in production)

**Production Recommendations:**
- Implement authentication/authorization
- Use HTTPS for all communications
- Encrypt videos in transit and at rest
- Add rate limiting
- Implement audit logging
- Comply with HIPAA/GDPR regulations

## Performance Considerations

**Current Configuration:**
- CPU-only processing (cuda=False)
- Synchronous video processing
- No caching

**Optimization Opportunities:**
- Enable GPU acceleration (cuda=True)
- Implement async processing with task queues
- Add result caching (Redis)
- Batch processing for multiple videos
- Model quantization for faster inference

## Next Steps

1. **Test with real videos** - Validate PyVHR extraction accuracy
2. **Collect training data** - Gather labeled clinical datasets
3. **Train production model** - Replace dummy model with real classifier
4. **Deploy backend** - Choose cloud platform (GCP, AWS, Azure)
5. **Add monitoring** - Implement metrics, logging, alerting
6. **Clinical validation** - Validate results with medical professionals
